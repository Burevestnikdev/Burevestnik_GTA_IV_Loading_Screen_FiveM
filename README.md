I welcome you CFX community!

Today I present to you the loading screen from GTA IV, which repeats the original loading screen from which you and your players will be delighted!

## How to use:

Example:
* Unzip the archive to the resources folder.
* Move the folder with the Loading Screen to the folder where you have the rest of the FiveM server resources.
* Write the line (unsure Burevestnik_fivem_Loading_Screen_GTA_IV) to your server.cfg
* Enjoy the new loading screen!

## Optimization (The script consumes):

0.00 ms in a quiet state.

0.00 ms in an active state.

## What does this system include:

* This system works on all versions of ESX, QBCore, as well as STANDALONE!
* You can customize the text, background, music, characters, animation, and number of appearances!
* You can completely change the user interface at will!
